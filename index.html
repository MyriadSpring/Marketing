            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>What is our main focus?</h3>
            <p>We focus on creating Facebook ad funnels that capture interested prospects, filter out those who are ready to be delivered, nurture those who are not yet ready, and retarget them with engaging content. We help you build a large potential prospect base and grow your social media presence.</p>
            <h3>What sets us apart?</h3>
            <p>We focus on the best marketing channels that deliver the best results, ensuring we don't waste your ad budget and deliver exceptional results. Our team of Vietnamese marketing experts work harder for our clients, providing results proportional to the value we charge.</p>
            <h3>Why is social media important?</h3>
            <p>Websites and search engines are no longer the most relevant platforms for marketing. To stand out from the competition, you need to establish your reputation and create content that builds trust with potential clients. Social media marketing takes time, but it's the most effective and direct way to grow your real estate business.</p>
            <h3>Who is our service best suited for?</h3>
            <p>Our services are perfect for real estate agents who are serious about expanding their business, ready to take on more clients, and willing to put themselves out there on social media.
